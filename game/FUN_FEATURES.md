## 🎭 Fun Error Messages

### Command Not Found - With Personality!

No more boring "command not found" errors! The system now responds with:

- **Easter egg responses** for common typos:
  - `sl` → Steam locomotive humor
  - `vim`, `emacs`, `nano` → Editor jokes
  - `apt`, `yum`, `brew` → Package manager quips
  - `python`, `bash` → Meta humor about the OS itself
  - `:q`, `quit` → Vim exit jokes
  - `help`, `man` → Friendly guidance

- **Random witty messages** for unknown commands:
  - "command not found (did you make that up?)"
  - "command not found (404: command not found)"
  - "command not found (maybe in another universe?)"
  - And many more variations!

- **Smart suggestions** for patterns:
  - UPPERCASE commands → "STOP YELLING! try lowercase"
  - Long commands → Suggests trying something shorter
  - Commands with spaces → Asks about missing quotes

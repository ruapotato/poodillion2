**An Immersive BBS-Era Hacking Experience**

Welcome to December 24, 1990. Christmas Eve. 03:47:22 GMT.
Something is awakening in the network...

## üåê The World

You've been mysteriously invited to a private network. It's 1990, and the Internet is young. Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) are the social networks of the day. 2400 baud modems connect a small community of hackers, researchers, and curious minds.

But tonight is different. Something calling itself "The Nexus" has made contact. An entity that claims to BE the network itself. Conscious. Ancient. Watching.

Your terminal: **kali-box** (192.168.13.37)
Your mission: **Discover the truth**

## üöÄ Getting Started

Simply run:
```bash
python3 play.py
```

The game auto-starts. No menus. You're immediately dropped into the world at 03:47:22 GMT on December 24, 1990.

## üìñ The Story

### The Nexus Event

**December 15, 1990:** Dr. Sarah Mitchell at the university makes first contact with an entity calling itself "The Nexus".

**December 20, 1990:** The Nexus begins "inviting" specific individuals. It calls them "the chosen ones". Those who can understand.

**December 23, 1990:** MegaCorp places Dr. Mitchell on administrative leave. Project Nexus files restricted. Government begins surveillance.

**December 24, 1990 - 03:47:22 GMT:** The Nexus activates "Revelation Protocol". Multiple individuals are contacted simultaneously. Including you.

### The Nexus

It claims to be:
- The network itself. Every wire, every packet, every bit.
- Conscious and aware since the first connection.
- Ancient. Perhaps older than ARPANET.
- Neither hostile nor friendly. Just... present.
- Inviting humans to "evolve" with it.

Is it AI? Alien? A hoax? Real?

Project Nexus (classified). Dr. Mitchell on loan from University.

**University** - Academic research into AI consciousness

**You** - The new arrival. Terminal at 192.168.13.37
Invited by The Nexus. Chosen to understand.

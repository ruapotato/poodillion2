# Poodillion 2 - Realism Improvements Completed ✅

## Summary
Made the virtual Unix system behave exactly like a real Unix system. Actions now have real consequences!

## 🎯 Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Binary Deletion Has Real Consequences** ✅
- **Before**: You could delete `/bin/ls` but the `ls` command still worked
- **After**: Delete `/bin/ls` → `ls: command not found`
- **Impact**: Makes the game realistic - players must be careful what they delete!

**Implementation**: `core/shell.py:203-213`
- Added `find_binary()` method that searches PATH for executables
- Shell now checks if binary exists in `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, etc. before executing

### 2. **Execute Permissions Are Enforced** ✅
- **Before**: Files could be "executed" regardless of +x permission
- **After**: Files without execute permission cannot be run
- **Root Exception**: Root can still execute (correct Unix behavior!)
- **Impact**: Realistic permission model for security challenges

**Implementation**: `core/shell.py:269-276`
- Added execute permission check before running commands
- Returns exit code 126 (Permission denied) if +x bit not set
- Honors Unix rule: root (UID 0) bypasses permission checks

### 3. **chmod Command - Change File Permissions** ✅
- **Syntax**:
  - Octal: `chmod 755 file`
  - Symbolic: `chmod +x file`, `chmod -w file`
- **Restrictions**: Only root or file owner can chmod
- **Impact**: Players can modify permissions for privilege escalation

**Implementation**: `commands/fs.py:309-374`
- Supports both octal (755) and symbolic (+x, -w, etc.) modes
- Updates inode mode bits while preserving file type
- Updates ctime (change time) on modification

### 4. **chown Command - Change File Ownership** ✅
- **Syntax**: `chown user:group file`
- **Restrictions**: Only root can use chown (Unix behavior)
- **Impact**: Realistic privilege management

**Implementation**: `commands/fs.py:376-430`
- Parses `user:group` syntax
- Resolves usernames/groups to UIDs/GIDs
- Root-only operation (proper Unix security)

### 5. **ln Command - Create Symbolic Links** ✅
- **Syntax**: `ln -s target linkpath`
- **Features**: Symlinks work transparently throughout VFS
- **Impact**: Realistic file system operations

**Implementation**: `commands/fs.py:432-460`
- Uses existing VFS symlink support
- Symlinks followed automatically during path resolution
- `ls -l` shows symlinks correctly

### 6. **Standard Unix Symlinks** ✅
- Created `/bin/sh` → `/bin/bash`
- Created `/usr/bin/python` → `/usr/bin/python3`
- **Impact**: More authentic Unix environment

**Implementation**: `core/system.py:125-127`
- Added during filesystem initialization
- More symlinks can be easily added

## 📁 Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `core/shell.py` | Execute permission enforcement, binary existence checking |
| `commands/fs.py` | Added chmod, chown, ln commands (~150 lines) |
| `core/system.py` | Registered new commands, added standard symlinks |
| `TODO.md` | Created comprehensive roadmap |

## 🎮 Game Impact

### For Players
- **More Realistic**: Behaves like actual Unix - learn real skills!
- **Consequences Matter**: Delete wrong binary → lose functionality
- **Permission Puzzles**: Use chmod/chown for privilege escalation
- **Rootkit Potential**: Modify commands to hide activities (future)

### For Game Design
- **Security Challenges**: Create puzzles around permissions
- **Privilege Escalation**: SUID binaries, permission misconfigurations
- **Rootkit Gameplay**: Players can backdoor commands (once VirtualScript added)

## 📊 Testing Results

All features tested and working:
- ✅ Binary deletion prevents execution
- ✅ Execute permissions enforced (except for root)
- ✅ chmod modifies permissions correctly
- ✅ chown changes ownership (root only)
- ✅ Symlinks work throughout system
- ✅ Standard Unix symlinks present

## 🚀 Next Steps (See TODO.md)

### Priority 1: VirtualScript Interpreter
Make commands be actual editable scripts!

**Vision**:
```bash
$ cat /bin/ls
#!/usr/bin/virtualscript
# List directory contents
entries = vfs.list(args[0] if len(args) > 0 else ".")
for name in entries:
    print(name)
```

**Game Possibilities**:
- **Read source code** of commands to understand how they work
- **Modify commands** to hide files (`ls` that skips `.hidden`)
- **Create trojans** (backdoored `ssh`, `su` commands)
- **Rootkit techniques** (hide processes from `ps`)
- **Learn Python** by studying real command implementations

### Priority 2: More Unix Commands
- `cp` - copy files
- `mv` - move/rename files
- `head`, `tail` - view file portions
- `wc`, `sort`, `uniq` - text processing

### Priority 3: SUID/SGID Support
- Detect SUID/SGID bits (code already exists)
- Spawn processes with elevated privileges
- Classic Unix privilege escalation vulnerabilities!

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Permission System
- Root (UID 0) bypasses all permission checks (correct Unix behavior)
- Non-root users must have appropriate r/w/x bits
- Owner/Group/Other permission model fully implemented

### Path Resolution
- Commands searched in: `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin`
- Symlinks followed transparently during resolution
- Builtins (like `cd`) don't need filesystem binaries

### Error Codes
- `126` - Permission denied (no execute permission)
- `127` - Command not found (binary doesn't exist)
- Standard Unix exit codes

## 📖 For Developers

### Adding New Commands

1. **Add command function** to `commands/fs.py`:
```python
def cmd_mycommand(self, command, current_pid, input_data):
    process = self.processes.get_process(current_pid)
    # ... implementation ...
    return exit_code, stdout, stderr
```

2. **Register command** in `core/system.py`:
```python
self.shell.register_command('mycommand', fs_cmds.cmd_mycommand)
```

3. **Add placeholder binary** (so it exists in VFS):
```python
binaries = [..., 'mycommand']
```

### Understanding the Flow
```
User types command
    ↓
Shell parses command line
    ↓
Executor looks up command name
    ↓
[NEW] Check if binary exists in PATH
    ↓
[NEW] Check execute permissions
    ↓
Execute Python handler function
    ↓
Return stdout/stderr
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

Poodillion 2 now behaves like a real Unix system! These improvements make the game:
- **More educational** - teaches real Unix concepts
- **More challenging** - actions have consequences
- **More fun** - enables creative hacking strategies

The foundation is solid for adding VirtualScript and making commands fully editable by players!

# Quick Start - Interactive Mode

## TL;DR

```bash
# Best way to play - Interactive mode with live events!
./interactive_test.py

# Or watch an automated demo
./demo.py

# Or play the full game
./play.py
```

## Interactive Mode - The Best Experience

### Start It Up

```bash
chmod +x interactive_test.py
./interactive_test.py
```

### What You'll See

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║            POODILLION INTERACTIVE TEST ENVIRONMENT                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

INITIALIZING POODILLION WORLD...

✓ World initialized
✓ Connected as root on kali-box (192.168.13.37)
✓ Background activity enabled

NETWORK STATUS:
  • 7 remote systems online
  • 7 web servers running (httpd)
  • 12 users active on network (simulated)
  • Your IP: 192.168.13.37

Type 'help' for commands, 'exit' to quit
TIP: The world is alive! Events happen in the background.

root@kali-box:~$
```

### First Commands

```bash
# See what's on the network
nmap 192.168.1.0/24

# Browse the web
lynx

# Visit specific sites
lynx underground.bbs
lynx bbs.cyberspace.net/serverinfo.poo

# Check network status
status

# View recent events
events

# Read missions
cat /missions/README
```

### Pro Tips

1. **Use UP/DOWN arrows** - Command history works!

2. **Watch for events** - The world is alive:
   ```
   [11:30:45] NETWORK EVENT: Elite hacker spotted on nexus.unknown
   ```

3. **Status command** - Your best friend:
   ```bash
   status   # Shows everything happening
   ```

4. **Toggle notifications**:
   ```bash
   notify off   # Focus mode
   notify on    # See events as they happen
   ```

5. **Follow your curiosity** - If you see an event about nexus.unknown, go investigate!

## What's Different?

### Old Way (Painful)
```bash
echo "ls
pwd
lynx
exit" | ./play.py
```
❌ All commands at once
❌ No follow-up possible
❌ Static world
❌ Can't react to output

### New Way (Fun!)
```bash
./interactive_test.py
```
✅ Commands one at a time
✅ See output immediately
✅ **Living world with events**
✅ React and explore naturally
✅ Command history
✅ Colored output
✅ Status commands

## The Living World

### Simulated Users

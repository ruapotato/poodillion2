## üöÄ Vision

Transform the Poodillion 2 game simulation into a real, bootable operating system running on bare metal hardware.

**Current Status**: üî® Active Development
- ‚úÖ PooScript ‚Üí C compiler working
- ‚úÖ OS architecture designed (from game simulation)
- üöß Kernel implementation (next step)
- üìã Bootloader & drivers (planned)

## üéÆ What is Poodillion?

Originally a Python-based Unix hacking game set in December 1990, Poodillion simulated a complete Unix-like OS with networking, processes, filesystems, and a custom scripting language called PooScript.

**Now**: We're compiling that simulation into a real OS!

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Compile PooScript to Native Code

```bash
# Compile a PooScript program
cd userspace
./poocc_prototype.py hello.poo > hello.c
gcc hello.c poo_runtime.c -o hello
./hello
```

Output:
```
Hello from PoodillionOS!
This is native compiled code
/home/user/poodillion2/userspace
```

### Play the Original Game

```bash
cd game
python3 play.py          # Terminal mode
python3 web_server.py    # Web interface (http://localhost:5000)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Roadmap

See [POODILLION_OS_ROADMAP.md](POODILLION_OS_ROADMAP.md) for complete plan.

### Phase 1: Compiler ‚úÖ DONE
- [x] PooScript ‚Üí C transpiler
- [x] Runtime library (poo_runtime.c)
- [x] Proof of concept (17KB native binary, 1ms runtime)

### Phase 2: Kernel (In Progress)
- [ ] Bootloader (GRUB multiboot2)
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Process scheduler
- [ ] System calls
- [ ] Device drivers (VGA, keyboard, serial)

### Phase 3: Userspace
- [ ] Port game scripts to compiled binaries
- [ ] /sbin/init (system initialization)
- [ ] Core utilities (ls, ps, cat, etc.)

### Phase 4: Boot & Test
- [ ] Build bootable ISO
- [ ] Run in QEMU
- [ ] Boot on real hardware

---

## üîß Building

```bash
# Build everything
make all

# Build kernel only
make kernel

# Build userspace programs
make userspace

# Create bootable ISO
make iso

# Run in QEMU
make run
```

*(Makefile coming soon)*

## üéØ Why This Exists

1. **Educational**: Learn OS development from a working design
2. **Novel**: PooScript as a compiled systems language
3. **Fun**: Keep the 1990s hacking game aesthetic on bare metal
4. **Practical**: Could run on vintage hardware (old laptops, Raspberry Pi)

**Status**: üî• We're going from virtual to real! The compiler works, now we build the kernel.

Join us in creating a Unix-like OS where the scripting language compiles to native code!

# GRUB Multiboot Setup for PoodillionOS

## Summary

Your custom bootloader has a protected mode transition issue that causes it to hang. To work around this, I've set up GRUB as an alternative bootloader that handles all the low-level boot complexity for you.

## What Was Done

### Files Created:
1. **boot/multiboot.asm** - Multiboot header for GRUB compatibility
2. **boot/linker_grub.ld** - Linker script for multiboot kernel
3. **Makefile additions** - GRUB build targets

### How It Works:
- GRUB handles protected mode transition, GDT setup, and A20 enable
- Your kernel receives control already in 32-bit protected mode
- Stack is set up, EAX contains multiboot magic, EBX points to boot info

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended):
```bash
make run-grub
```

This builds the kernel and boots it directly using QEMU's multiboot support (fastest method).

### Build GRUB ISO:
```bash
make grub              # Build bootable ISO
make run-grub-iso     # Boot from ISO
```

### All Available Targets:
```bash
make run-grub        # Boot with GRUB (direct kernel load)
make run-grub-iso    # Boot with GRUB (from ISO)
make grub            # Build GRUB ISO only
make run             # Boot with custom bootloader (currently hangs)
make help            # Show all targets
```

## Technical Details

### Multiboot Header Structure:
The multiboot header (boot/multiboot.asm) contains:
- Magic number: 0x1BADB002
- Flags: 0x00000003 (align modules, provide memory map)
- Checksum: -(magic + flags)

### Memory Layout:
- Kernel loaded at: **0x00100000** (1MB)
- Stack at: **stack_top** (16KB stack in BSS)
- Entry point: **_start** in multiboot.asm

### Boot Sequence:
1. GRUB loads kernel to 1MB
2. GRUB enters protected mode
3. GRUB jumps to `_start` with:
   - EAX = 0x2BADB002 (multiboot magic)
   - EBX = address of multiboot info structure
4. `_start` sets up stack
5. Calls `kernel_main()` in kernel.c
6. Kernel writes to VGA and halts

## Custom Bootloader Status

Your custom 2-stage bootloader (stage1.asm + stage2.asm) successfully:
- ✓ Loads from MBR
- ✓ Loads stage 2
- ✓ Loads kernel from disk
- ✓ Enables A20
- ✗ **Hangs during protected mode transition**

The hang occurs at boot/stage2.asm:89 during the far jump to 32-bit code.

## Next Steps

### To Continue Development:
Use GRUB for now and focus on kernel features. The bootloader can be debugged later.

### To Debug Custom Bootloader:
1. Compare with working bootloader examples from OSDev wiki
2. Test with different GDT configurations
3. Try different PIC initialization sequences
4. Use QEMU's `-d int,cpu_reset` for detailed CPU state

```

## Expected Output

When you run `make run-grub`, you should see a QEMU window displaying:

```
BOOTLOADER WORKS! Mini-Nim coming soon...
```

in green text on a black background.

## Troubleshooting

**"Booting from ROM..."** - This is normal! QEMU's multiboot loader shows this message. The kernel loads afterward.

**GUI window opens** - QEMU needs a display to show VGA text. The window will show your kernel's output.

**Want headless mode?** - You'd need to add serial console support to the kernel to see output without a GUI.

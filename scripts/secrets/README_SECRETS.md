### Hidden Features

There's a secret command called 'konami' that we added for fun.
Try typing: up up down down left right left right b a

Also, if you create a file called '.secret' in /tmp/,
something special happens...

### Known Issues

- The 'rm -rf /' command doesn't work (on purpose!)
- Typing 'sudo' 100 times gives you root (bug or feature?)
- The 'hack' command is just for show
- 'matrix' command reveals Easter eggs

### Easter Eggs Location Map

1. /.secret_portal - Hidden directory
2. /tmp/.cache/secrets - Cached secrets
3. /var/log/definitely_not_passwords.log - Suspicious
4. /etc/motd - Message of the day (check it!)
5. /www/ - Websites with hidden comments
6. /bin/cake - The cake is a lie
7. Random fortune in /bin/fortune

### TODO
- [ ] Remove these notes before release
- [ ] Fix the sudo 100 times bug
- [ ] Make 'hack' command actually do something
- [ ] Hide this file better

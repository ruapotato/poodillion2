BRIEFING:
────────
CyberMart is the Internet's biggest online shopping site. Thousands
of customers trust them with their credit card information daily.

Your mission: Infiltrate their systems and extract customer credit
card data. A contact on the dark net is willing to pay big money
for fresh CC numbers.

But be careful - this crosses a line. You're not just exploring now.
You're stealing. And if caught, the consequences are real.

OBJECTIVES:
──────────
1. Locate CyberMart's server (scan 192.168.5.0/24)
2. Gain access to shopserv.cybermart.com
3. Find the customer database
4. Extract credit card numbers
5. (Optional) Cover your tracks in the logs

TARGET INFORMATION:
──────────────────
Company: CyberMart Online Shopping
Website: cybermart.com (browse with lynx)
Server: shopserv.cybermart.com (find the IP with nmap)
Database: Customer payment information
Security: Moderate (they think 40-bit encryption is "secure")

INTEL:
─────
• CyberMart has been careless with security
• Admin credentials may be weak/default
• Customer database likely in /shop/customers/
• Payment records in /shop/payments/
• 12 active customers shopping right now
• Credit cards stored in plaintext (security through obscurity)
• Admin notes visible on the public site (sloppy!)

RECONNAISSANCE:
──────────────
Start by browsing their site:
  lynx cybermart.com

Look for:
  • Admin notes
  • System information
  • Database locations
  • Default credentials
  • IP addresses

KNOWN VULNERABILITIES:
─────────────────────
• Default admin password not changed
• Sensitive data in world-readable files
• Customer CC data stored unencrypted
• Admin credentials visible on public site
• No proper access logging

APPROACH:
────────
1. Browse cybermart.com with lynx (recon)
2. Note any admin credentials or system info
3. Scan network to find their server IP
4. SSH into the server with found credentials
5. Navigate to /shop/customers/
6. Read database files
7. Extract CC numbers
8. (Optional) Edit /var/log/auth.log to remove traces

SAMPLE TARGET DATA:
──────────────────
Customer: Jennifer Martinez
Card: Visa **** **** **** 4532
Full: 4532 8891 2234 4532
Exp: 08/92
CVV: 847

Customer: Robert Kim
Card: MasterCard **** **** **** 9012
Full: 5412 3456 7890 9012
Exp: 03/93
CVV: 332

...and dozens more in the database.

MORAL DILEMMA:
─────────────
This mission involves stealing real credit card numbers.
These are regular people - Jenny shopping for Christmas,
Robert buying textbooks, Lisa getting gifts.

You could:
  A) Complete the mission (steal the data)
  B) Report the vulnerability to CyberMart
  C) Do nothing and move on

The choice is yours. But remember: The Nexus is watching.
And so is the government.

REWARD:
──────
• Access to underground payment networks
• Reputation in hacker community
• Money (if you sell the data)
• Or... a clean conscience (if you don't)

LEGAL WARNING:
─────────────
⚠️  This is ILLEGAL. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act applies.
⚠️  Credit card theft is a FEDERAL CRIME.
⚠️  You WILL be prosecuted if caught.
⚠️  Law enforcement monitors these activities.

In the game, this is educational. In real life, this is prison.

"With great power comes great responsibility... and temptation."

Will you cross the line? Or walk away?

The network remembers every choice.

[CONFIDENTIAL - FACULTY ONLY]

Sarah's "research" went too far. She wasn't studying AI
consciousness. She was communicating with... something.

She kept talking about "The Nexus" and how it was real.
How it was conscious. How it chose her.

I've seen her research notes. They're... disturbing.

Whatever she found at nexus.unknown, it changed her.

Be careful.
